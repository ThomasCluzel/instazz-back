# instazz-back

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ThomasCluzel/instazz-back.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ThomasCluzel/instazz-back)

This project is the backend of the InstaZZ app of the course ZZ3-javascript-ecosystems

Throughout this course, we will build a social-network with a
principle similar to Instagram.

_Disclaimer_: this is not a copy of Instagram, this project is made by students
for learning purpose only.

## Launching MongoDB
Launch a local Mongo database for the API to work
```sh
docker-compose -f docker-compose-mongo.yml up -d
```

## Content of the .env file

Required content of the ".env" file
```
# Database connection string
MONGO=mongodb://<user>:<passwd>@<host>

#Database connection string for tests
MONGO_TEST=mongodb://<user>:<passwd>@<host>

# API port
PORT=5000

# Seed used to hash the JWT token
JWT_SECRET=xxx

# Path where images should be uploaded (must exists)
UPLOAD_PATH=/path

# Path where images used during test should be uploaded (must exists). They are deleted at the end of each test.
UPLOAD_TEST_PATH=/path
```

## Some useful commands

Launch server
```sh
npm run start
```

## API documentation

If a request fails, it returns an HTTP status of value 500 with an error message (status will be replaced by more adapted ones in the future).

### Users

#### Create a user

Post request on localhost:5000/api/v1/users/, with Content-Type=application/json and with the body as follow:
```json
{
	"name": "myName",
	"pseudo": "myPseudo",
	"password": "myPassword"
}
```

If the username is already taken, you get an error: "Username is already taken"

Otherwise, you are signed in and connected. The returned value is:
```json
{
    "succes": true,
    "token": "xxx",
    "_id": "xxx",
    "pseudo": "myPseudo",
    "name": "myName",
    "role": "myRole"
}
```

#### Sign in

Post request on localhost:5000/api/v1/users/signin with Content-Type=application/json and with the body as follow:
```json
{
	"pseudo": "myPseudo",

}
```

The returned value is:
```json
{
    "succes": true,

    "name": "myName",
    "role": "myRole"
